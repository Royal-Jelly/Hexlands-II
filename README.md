# Hexlands II
Jelly's Deecree II is a RPG pack containing Minimal tech & instead focusing on Magic, Exploration, & Bountiful Bounties.
 

We offer Custom Bounties via bountiful which now give coins instead of random items, promoting a RPG like server economy.
 

Use of KubeJS for new items and recipe Tweaks which were necessary mod balancing to promote unique inter mod interactions.
